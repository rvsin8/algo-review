Compress
Write a function, compress, that takes in a string as an argument. The function should return a compressed version of the string where consecutive occurences of the same characters are compressed into the number of occurences followed by the character. Single character occurences should not be changed.

const compress = (s) => {
  let result = [];
  let i = 0;
  let j = 0;
  
  while (j <= s.length) {
    if (s[i] === s[j]) {
      j += 1;
    } else {
      const num = j - i;
      if (num === 1) {
        result.push(s[i]);
      } else {
        result.push(String(num), s[i]);
      }
      i = j;
    }
  }
  
  return result.join('');
};
