//Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
//
//If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
//
//The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [1,2,3]
//Output: [1,3,2]
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [3,2,1]
//Output: [1,2,3]
//Example 3:
//
//Input: nums = [1,1,5]
//Output: [1,5,1]
//Example 4:
//
//Input: nums = [1]
//Output: [1]
// 
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= nums.length <= 100
//0 <= nums[i] <= 100


//my understanding
//we are going to have an array and we are going to have numbers in that array and if we were to read that array like its a number, whe want to return the next number, what would be the next highest number?
//sort it in ascending order
//we can't use any ds that can rearrange our set
//we want to do this is in n time, we want to do this in place
//2n time complexity, passes 2 times

// objective: find next (larger) permutation. If not
    // avilable, sort ascending
// method: Iterate from before-last right to left and see if you find curr < next.
    // Once you do, find next larger than 'curr', and swap 'curr' with it
    // Reverse all els to right of 'curr' to make next larger perm
// complexity: 
    // time: O(N), space: O(1)
    // N => nums.length
