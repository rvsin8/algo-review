Chapter 1 - The Role of Algorithms in Computing 

1.1 Algorithms 
- informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, 
as input and produces some value, or sets of values as output. It is thus a sequence of computational steps that
transform the input into the output.
- we can also view an algo as a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem. The statement of the pro-
blem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship.
