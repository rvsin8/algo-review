//Youngest Common Ancestor
//Graphs

//my understanding 
//gives us three inputs - the first one is the top ancestor and the other two inputs are two descendants of that ancestor
//we are told the three inputs are part of one class that has a ancestor property
//we want to bring the nodes at the same level and then find the youngest common ancestor
//yo what the fuck is going on

//time complexity
//O(d) where d is the depth

//space complexity 
//O(1) bc we can write this algo iteratively with a few while loops and nothing needs to be stored

//yo come back to this one
