//Remove Islands
//Graphs

//my understanding
//we are given an input matrix aka a 2D array made up of only 1s and 0s
//0 = white and 1 = black
//an island is any number of 1 that are adjacaent or vertical, not on edges
//output has to be the islands replaced by 0s

//easiest way
//loop through the entire array
//when we hit a 1 we will do a check and perform a function
//look at the 1's neighbors
//do this for all positions
//once we find an island we replace it with a 0
//we keep doing this 

//clever solution 1
//we can start by looping through the first row, first col, last row and last col
//we find all ones connected to the ones at these edges
//we store their positions and then loop through the interior 1 that are not connected to the edges and replace it with 0
//create another 2D array that is identical to this array but have them all to false values
//by doing this we can look at corresponding values via DFS
//whatever is a true value are not islands so we keep those values
//when we see the 1's that are false - we replace it with 0's

//clever solution 2
//instead of creating a ds with true and flase values
//we can replace all the edges 1 with 2
//replace the 1's connected to the 1 on the edges with 2 as well
//we replace all 2's with 1's and all 1's with 0's

//time complexity 
//O(wh) where w id width and h is height, at most we can look at every position

//space complexity 
//O(wh) where w is width and h is height, we have to create another ds the same exact size of our original array
//there is one that runs in constant space but its too complicated
//for solution 2 we use DFS which uses a stack
