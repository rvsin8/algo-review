//River Sizes
//Graphs

//my understanding
//classic graph traversal 
//you are given a matrix aka 2d array, not an equal width and height
//contains 0 and 1, 0 is land and 1 is river 
//1's next to each other are rivers as well
//we have to return an array of all the sizes of river
//adjacent 1's do not count only horizontal and vertical 
//we need to keep track of all 1's so we should treat it as a graph
//if we treat this matrix as a graph we can treat every ele as a node 
//each node has a value 0 or 1 and each node has a neighboring node
//you can traverse this matrix and at every node we check its every value, if it has a value 1 we can apply either DFS or BFS to find its length
//whenever we find the value 1 we can start exploring its neighboring nodes and if that neighbor is also 1 so we do the same for that neighbor 
//you will xplore a bunch of nodes multiple times we need to improve this 
//we will keep track of a node we have visited and when we arrive to it again we just simply ignore it
//we can do explore them iteratively or recursively 
//we found another 1 so we increase the length to 2 and we explore that new 1 and find no other neighbor so the length we add to our final array is 2
//and so on we do this for every node

//time complexity 
//O(w*h) w is the length and h is the height of the matrix
//we visit every node at least once

//space complexity 
//O(w*h) we are going to building this auxillary data structure the same exact size
