//Search In Sorted Matrix
//Searching

//my understanding
//look for a number in a 2D array aka a matrix
//matrix is sorted, every row and col are sorted in ascending order
//we have a target number and if it is in the matrix then we want the indices at which that matrix is placed
//a sorted matrix can tell us ? we can start from the middle of the matrix which is 33 and it is smaller than our target number which is 44
//this helps us eliminate all the numbers above and to the left of 33 since they are smaller than 44 as well
//we have to search to the right and to the bottom of 33
//it gets rid of the top left corner
//but lets try another way
//start at the top right which is a 1000 and a 1000 is > 44
//it tells us that 44 cannot be in the column bc 1000 is on top so we get rid of an entire column
//move to the left to 15 which is < 44
//it tells us we can get rid of that row that 15 is in
//now we move below 15 to 32 which is also < 44 so we get rid of that column as well
//we move again to the bottom to 35 and its < 44, so we eliminate the left again
//now we are at 45 and it is > 44 and we get rid of the bottom 
//we then go to the left and we hit 44 our target number and now we can return the indices it is at --> [3,3]

//time complexity 
//O(n + m) where n is the length of the rows and m is the length of the columns
//greatest amount of traversal we can do is to opposite corners where we traverse an entire column and row

//space complexity
//O(1) we are not storing anything we can do this traversal in place

function searchInSortedMatrix(matrix, target) {
    let row = 0; //row starts at the first idx which is 0 and we keep track of this
    let col = matrix[0].length - 1; //keep track of column which starts at the last value of the first row which is -1
    while (row < matrix.length && col >= 0) { //traverse through our matrix while our row is less than our matrix and the column is >= 0
        if (matrix[row][col] > target) { //if the matrix at our row and at our column are greater than our target number
            col--; //we move our column to the left - decrementing it
        } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) { //if it is less than our target
            row++; //we move down the row, we are incrementing our row
        } else {
            return [row, col]; //else means we found it and we return our indices of our target value
        }
    }
    return [-1, -1]; //if it is not found we return -1,-1
