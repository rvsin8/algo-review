//Longest Palindromic Substring
//Strings

//my understanding 
//gives us a string of characters, write a function that will return the largest substring in the string that is a palindrome
//abaxyzzyxf --> xyzzyx
//get all possible substrings and for each one check if it a palindrome  is one way to solve it but has bad time complexity 
//we can make this better - when youre in the middle of a palindrome we can see if the substr next to the letter are mirror-like
//we can treat each leeter as if it is the middle char of a palindrome
//if the palindrome is odd length there is a middle letter if not its a direct mirror and pali is just between two letter
//a is the first letter of the pali -> can't nothing is to the left
//b is the next, to the left is a and to the right is a, so it is a palindrome aba, can we go farther out ? no bc in the left we are out of the string, we also have to check a even length check and a and b are not equal to each other 
//second a i the next one, to the left is b and to the right is x and is not a palindrome same goes for even length palindrome 
//and so on until we hit second z where we have a even palindrome with the length of 6


//more optimal time complexity
//O(n^2) where n is the length of input string
//we are iterating through the array once O(n) time, we do two expansions after every iterations one at the letter and one in btw the letters


//more optimal space complexity
//O(n) bc we slice and store the final substring

    let currentLongest = [0, 1]; //define our current longest palindrome, we will update this throughout the algorithm //we initialize it to 0 and 1

        rightIdx++;//we do the same for the right as ^
    }
