//Three Sums
//Arrays

//my understandings 
//find all the possible triplets that sum up to the target sum
//[12,3,1,2,-6,5,-8,6], 0 --> [[-8,2,6], [-8,3,5], [-6,1,5]]
//we can do this by sorting this in ascending order and using two pointers - left / right
//[-8,-6,1,2,3,5,6,12], 0
//iterate through the array once 
//we start with -8
//have a left pointer one ele ahead of -8 at -6
//have a right pointer at the end of the array at 12
//currentSum = currentNum + leftNum + rightNum
//CS = CN + L + R
//CS = -8 + -6 + 12 = -2 nope, since it less than our target num 0 so if we move our left pointer by 1 we are guaranteed to have a bigger sum
//CS = -8 + 1 + 12 = 5 nope, since it is greater than our target num we need to move our right pointer to the left by 1
//CS = -8 + 1 + 6 = -1 nope, we move our left pointer to the right 
//CS = -8 + 2 + 6 = 0 yes !
//when they overlap we are done with this round of iteration
//so on

//time complexity 
//O(n^2) where n is the length of our input array, we iterate through and we do things with each num whether its adding or comparing

//space complexity 
//O(n) we store the triplets
