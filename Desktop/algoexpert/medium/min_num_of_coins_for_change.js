//Min Number of Coins for Change
//Dynamic ProgrammingÃ¥

//my notes
//we get two inputs
//one is an integer value of the amount of money
//the other input is an array of integer values that represent coin denomination
//$6 [1,2,4] --> 2 is the solution (4 + 2)
//minimum amount of coins we need to reach $6
//we are going to build this problem up
//we will build an array of length 7, 6 + 1
//at idx 0 we have $0, idx 1 we have $1, idx 2 we have $2, idx 3 we have $3 and so on
//we will figure out what is the min num of coins we need for each idx
//$0 we need 0 coins so we have 0 on idx 0
//$1, is 1 <= 1, yes it is so there is at-least 1 way to get to that
//$2, is 1 <= 2, yes 2-1 = 1 coin here, and one coin already and we get 1 + 1 = 2 at idx2
//the list goes on for all denoms
//for $2 we have the idx respectively as - 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3
//for $4 we have 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2 
//for each denom and amount we are building, if the denom <= amount : we can update our nums array --> nums[amount] = minimum (nums[amount], 1 + nums[amount - denom] ]
//confused

//time complexity
//O(nd) iterating through the array of denoms and amount, d is the num of denominations we have

//space complexity
//O(n) building an array

function minNumberOfCoinsForChange(n, denoms) {
    const numOfCoins = new Array(n+1).fill(Infinity); //initialize array, we will fill it up with infinity bc it will simplify our formula 
    numOfCoins[0] = 0; //to make 0 dollars we need 0 coins
    for (const denom of denoms) { //for loop
        for (let amount = 0; amount < numOfCoins.length; amount++){ //in range
            if (denom <= amount) { //can we even use our current coin to generate this ammount, if its less then we apply our formula
                numOfCoins[amount] = Math.min(numOfCoins[amount], numOfCoins[amount - denom] + 1); //i dunno?
            }
        }
    }
    return numOfCoins[n] !== Infinity ? numOfCoins[n] : -1; //review this
