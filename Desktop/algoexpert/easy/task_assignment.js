//Task Assignment
//Greedy Algorithm

//my understanding 
//we get two inputs for this - one is a positive k which is the num of workers that must complete the tasks and the other is the duration of tasks that must be completed and will always be atleast 2k
//[[4,2],[0,5],[3,1]]
//these tasks are going to be denoted of their idx
//[4,2] mean task wt idx4 and task with idx2 which is duration task of 2 and duration task 1
//[0,l5]  means idx0 task is 1sec and idx5 task is 4s
//4,2 = 1 + 5 = 6
//0,5 = 1 + 4 = 5
//3,1 = 3 + 3 = 6
//we sort it - [1,1,3,3,4,5]
//1,5 = 6
//1,4 = 5
//3,3 = 6
//we want the longest task to be paired to the shorted one to be paired up
//keep track of indices bc thats what we to give as our answer


//time complexity 
//O(nlog(n)) - bc its a sorting algorithm


//space complexity
//O(n) we need to keep track of the tasks and their pairings, we need a new list with n ele inside it
