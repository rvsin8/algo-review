//Remove Duplicates From Linked List
//Linked Lists

//my understanding
//we will be given a linked list
//we want to remove the duplicate values and return the linked lists with all those integers removed
//1 -> 1 --> 3 --> 4 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> 6
//the list will always be sorted
//these nodes will be represented by objects
//our nodes will have a value and a next attribute (go to another node or null/none)

//solution
//all our dups will be grouped together since it is in ascending order
//we go integer by integer we will look to the left and/or the right to see if there are dups
//we have to change the next attribute once we find a dup to a different value and then delete the dup integer it originally pointed too
//currentNode = head
//temp = currentNode.next.next
//currentNode.next = temp
//at idx 0 we have 1
//we have current node and we are looking for the next distinct node
//we want to change the next pointer that 1 is pointing to, to a distinct value
//our next distinct hits 3 and that is where the pointer will point to next
//now our current node points to 3 and our next distinct to 4
//we move to the next current node to 4
//we move our next distinct node which is also 4, again it is also 4 and then it is 5
//we then point first 4 to 5 now 
//and we do the same for 5 and have it point to one of the 6
//for 6 our next distinct node will be none

//time complexity 
//O(n) bc all we have to do is through all of the nodes ONCE


//space complexity
//O(1) we use no extra space


function removeDuplicatesFromLinkedList(linkedList) {
    let currentNode = linkedList; //first node of our linked list
    while (currentNode !== null) { //while its not none means we still have nodes 
        let nextDistinctNode = currentNode.next; //the next distinct node is linked
        while (nextDistinctNode !== null && nextDistinctNode.value === currentNode.value) { //while next distinct node is not none and is equal to the current node value
            nextDistinctNode = nextDistinctNode.next; //we change the next distinct node once we find a match
        }

        currentNode.next = nextDistinctNode; //uh?
        currentNode = nextDistinctNode; //current distinct node is equal to current node
