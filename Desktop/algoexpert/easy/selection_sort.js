//Selection Sort
//Sorting

//you are given a list of numbers and  and ordered and unordered list
//[8,5,2,9,5,6,3]
//we have a pointer where we traverse and array to find a smaller num than 8 aka 5
//we keep doing bc 2 is less than 5
//2 is the smallest so we did not find any smaller num in the array so we swap the 2 with 8 so it can be the first ele in the array
//and so on
//[2,5,8,9,5,6,3]
//[2,3,8,9,5,6,5] and so on

//time complexity
//O(n^2) - we kept iterating through the array and reduce the length by 1 each iteration


//space complexity
//O(1) - we are not storing anything just swapping
