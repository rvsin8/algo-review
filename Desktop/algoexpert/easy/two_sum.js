//Two Sum
//Arrays

//my understandings 
//gives an array of distinct integer values
//a separate integers value that gives you a target sum
//we need to see if there is a pair in the array that sums up to the target sum
//[3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6], 10 --> 11 - 1
//we can use two for loops but its not optimal for a time point of view
//a better way may be a hash table, may cost extra space but will make our time complexity better 
//we can create a hash table and traverse our array and at each number we stop at see if it equals our target num
//we can have targetSum = 10, and have currentNum = x and find y, where x + y = 10 or y = 10 - x
//if y is in our hash table, we return x and y.
//we start at 3, y = 10 - 3 --> 7
//then 5, 10 - 5 --> y = 5
//next is 10 - (-4) = 14
//hash table right now --> {3 = true, 5 = true, 4 = true}
//10 - 8 = 2
//10 - 11 = -1 
//10 - 1 = 9
//10 - (-1) = 11 it is in our hash table so return [11, -1]
//hashtable = {3 = true, 5 = true, -4 = true, 8 = true, 11 = true, 1 = true}
//O(n) time bc we traverse our array once and calculate for y
//O(n) space bc we are adding values to our hash table 

//medium optimal solution 
//the array is not sorted, but we can solve it more optimally than the solution with 2 for loops via sorting it
//we can put a left pointer at the first num at the array and we can put a right pointer in the last num of the array
//we can sum up the two nums L and R point at like -4 + 11 = 7 not valid
//we know 7 is less than sum and we are sorted, so we can move the right pointer to the left we know we will get a smaller sum so we should move the left pointer to the right 
//-1 + 11 = 10 and we found our answer 

//time complexity 
//O(nlog(n))

//space complexity 
//O(1)

function twoNumberSum(array, targetSum) {
    array.sort((a,b) => a - b);//sort the array in ascending order 
    let left = 0;//declare left pointer to our first idx
    let right = array.length - 1; //right pointer in our last idx
    while (left < right) { //aslong as the pointers do not overlap
        const currentSum = array[left] + array[right]; //the current sum will be the sum of the left and right pointers 
        if (currentSum === targetSum) { //if the current sum is our target sum
            return [array[left], array[right]]; //then we found our answer
        } else if (currentSum < targetSum) { //otherwise if our current sum is less than our target then we iterate left
            left++;
        } else if (currentSum > targetSum) { //if the current sum is greater than the target sum then we iterate right
