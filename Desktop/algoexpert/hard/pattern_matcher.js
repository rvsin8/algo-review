//Pattern Matcher
//Strings

//my understanding
//given two strings, first one is a patterns that consists of x's and y's --> "xxyxxy"
//second string is the main string "gogopowerrangergogopowerranger"
//does our main string match our pattern and what is the value of x and y
//answer is x = go and y = powerranger
//first thing we would do, is find how many instances of x or y appear in our pattern
//we generate a new pattern which will simplify our algorithm a lot
//we have to see if it starts with an x or a y
//to simplify our logic is to turn any pattern that starts with y and turn it to x
//getNewPattern will be a function that will create or return an array of our pattern, this is to check or do the switch
//getCountsandFirstYPos is a function is going to count the x's and y's and tell us where our first y is at after we iterate through our pattern in getNewPattern
//main function where we will do most logic
//lenofY will be the total string length - length of x and how many times they appear and divide it by 2 --> (30 - (1*4))/2
//firstYPos = 2, yIdx = firstYPos x lenofX --> 2 * 1 = 2
//x = "g" 
//y = "gopowerranger"
//we replace every x with g and every y with gopowerranger
//gggopowerrangergggopowerranger and this is not correct
//now we update lenofX to 2 and lenofY = (30 - 2 * 4) / 2 = 11
//yIdx = 2 * 2 = 4 this is where the y starts --> x = go and y = powerranger
//this is correct once we replace them in our pattern

//time complexity 
//O(n^2 + m) where n is the length of our input string and m is the length of the pattern bc the main function we iterating through the entire main string and at each point we are generating strings x and y, we are transforming our getnewpattern and we are comparing it

//space complexity
//O(n + m) where n is the length of our input string and m is the length of the pattern, when we replace all the x and y thus generating a string
