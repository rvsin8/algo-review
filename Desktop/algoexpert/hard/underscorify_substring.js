//Underscorify Substring
//Strings

//my understanding 
//we are given a string and a substring and we must wrap the substring in the original string in underscore
//"testthis is a testtest to see if testesttest it works", "test --> "_test_this is a _testtest_ to see if _testesttest_ it works",
//getLocations to find the substring on our string
//collapseLocation get the location and collapse them
//underscorify will add the underscores to our substring
//traverse main string and each idx find ths substring
//if we cannot find the substring then we return --> locations [[0,4]]
//we move on to idx1 bc our substring may overlap and keep doing this until we find test again
//we find test again in idx "10" --< locations [[0,4], [10,14]]
//move on to idx 11 and keep going until idx14 --> locations [[0,4], [10,14], [14,18]]
//collapseLocations [[0,4], [10,14], [14,18]] we need to collapse the last two array so [10,18] is what we get bc we had 2 14's which is 2 same idx so we know to combine those arrays
//so on until we hit the underscorify where we will insert the underscores into our string
//underscorify --> [_,t,e,s,t,_ ... so on] then return our aray then concatonate it and we are done
//

//time complexity
//O(n + m) where n is the string and m is the substring

//space complexity 
//O(n) where n is the length of our input string
