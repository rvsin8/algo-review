//Shifted Binary Search
//Searching

//my understanding 
//[45,61,71,72,73,0,1,21,33,45] 33 --> 8
//this may not always work, the array needs to have distinct numbers
//use the bs algorithm 
//you are given a sorted array of numbers that are shifted 45 - 73 and then 0 - 45
//find out if the target num is in the array and return the target idx in the array
//left pointer at 45 idx 0
//right pointer at 45 idx 9
//middle pointer = (0 + 9) / 2 = 4.5 and round it down to idx 4 which is 73
//usually in bs we compared our middle num 73 to 33, and since 73 is >, we erase the right side but we cannot do that here
//we can look at the leftmost pointer at 45 and realize it is > than 33
//if the left pointer is < or = our middle pointer then we want to check
//if our target number is < the middle number AND target num is >= the left num, then we explore the left side
//if its the opposite then we search the right side
//if the left num is > than the middle we know the left side is not sorted
//so 33 is < 73 and < 45 so we eliminate the left side and recalc the middle --> 5 + 9 = 14 / 2 = 7 so 21
//33 is > 21, so we eliminate the left 0 - 21 and we now arrive at our left pointer being at 33 and right at 45
//recalc middle pointer --> 8 +9 = 17 / 2 --> 8 aka 33
