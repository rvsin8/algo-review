//Sort K-Sorted Array
//Heaps

//my understanding
//we are given two inpurs - the first input is a partially sorted array and the second input will be the integer k and this value will always be greater than or equal to 0
//a k sorted array is defined as an array where the integers are k sorted from their sorted positions
//[3,2,1,5,4,7,6,5] 
//we can look at 1 being in idx 2 which is three positions away from where it should be at position 0
//we can look at 4 which is one position away
//no integer is more than 3 positions away from its sorted idx

//my solution
//the first thing we need to place at idx 0, we know it has to be to the left of the middle bc at most that integer can only be 3 idx away
//we only need to look at k+1 elements to consider for each idx
//for position 1 we can look 3 to the left or the right --> k + 1 elements to consider
//first we find idx 0 which is 1 the minimum element 
//then we pick the second minimum which is 2
//[5,4,7,6,5] are left and in our new array we have [1,2,3] so far
//so on
//much more efficient way than merge sort and other sort methods 
//a min heap may be a better method to use for this algorithm
//a min heap is a tree-like algorithm --> all children nodes must be greater than their parent node, so node A will be the minimum integers in the tree
//since A will always be the minimum, it will take constant time to look at O(1)
//to remove A would take O(log(n))
//to add an element takes the same as O(log(n))
//O(n) is what it takes to initialize a brand new heap

//continue
//we want to sort into place immediately 
//we want to initialize min heap and a variable to keep track of the next position (SortedIdx)
//we start with k + 1 elements in our min heap and then we loop from the k + 1 INDX
//we will remove our element in our min heap and sort it into our sorted idx
//now add the next element to the min heap
//repeat for the next idx
//repeat the process until we have a sorted array

//time complexity
//O(nlog(k)) we iterate through our input array and it takes log k operation  //look into this time complexity bc its confusing

//space complexity
//O(k) we have k + 1 or k elements in our heap
