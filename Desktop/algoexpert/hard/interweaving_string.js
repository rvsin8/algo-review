//Interweaving Strings
//Recursion

//my understanding
//we get three strings and we need to write a function whether the first two strings can be interwoven to be the third string
//edge case --> cancatonate which is also interweaving 
//grab the first and second string and put them one top of each other
//declare variables, two pointers that iterate through string 1 and string 2 to see if any letter is in the third string 
//figure out which string starts the third string off
//if one of the letter is equal to the letters in the third string is when recursion can occur
//after the first string does make sense, we go backwards and try the second string
//this is mad confusing 
//we should use caches so we can improve the time complexity and space complexity bc without caching it is 2^(N+M), n is the length with the first string and m is the length of second string  //its 2^ bc we always have two paths 
//space complexity is O(n+m) at most you will have n + m calls 

//time complexity
//O(nm) a cache will lead to this

//space complexity 
//O(nm) a cache will lead to this
