//Min Rewards
//Arrays

//my understandings
//given a list of integers and it represents a score that the students got in the final exam
//the order matters
//if a score is larger than another score next to it, it should have a higher reward and vice versa
//[8,4,2,1,3,6,7,9,5]
//[4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,1], 25
//if we keep iterating through the array, we will probably need to iterate back to update some scores
//when we are iterating back, the rewards array at idx j --> rewards[i] = max {rewards[j] pr rewards[j+1]+1}
//if you iterate from left to right, when you got a score that is greater than the previous one you just give it the rewards that the previous one had + 1, if it is smaller than the previous one then you give it 1 and start iterating it back, then you assign the max we already we assigned or whatever they got + 1 and pick the max of that
//that was the naive approach --> O(n^2) time and O(n)

//optimal solution
//we will use a technique called peaks and values, local max's and local min's
//we have trends in our scores as if we were to graph them going up and down
//in that graph you can find local mins and maxs
//finda a local min, i will expand to the local max's on both sides
//you just need to find the local mins and increment the rewards 
//you increment and stop when you hit peaks like 1, 2 3 4 and 2 3 4 5 until we hit the next local min
//how do you know if youre at a local peak
//it is an O(n) time and space 


//cleanest and optimal solution 
//instead of finding the local min and expanding we can just iterate to the right and to the left
//you can initialize all the scores to 1
//if it is not greater than the num to the left then skip it, if it is then increase it by 1
//1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 left to right
//4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 1 right to left 

//time complexity 
//O(n)

//space complexity 
//O(n)
